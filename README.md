# Machine-Learning---income-prediction-project
This project is a machine learning one. I used random forests to build a model that is able to pedict the cases income if it is over or under 50k annually. 
the used dataset is relatively old since 1994. For more information describing the dataset is available on the link: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp15/cse190-c/reports/sp15/048.pdf 
The project includes data cleaning, visulization, modeling, pca development, model tuning, and most important features visualization.
